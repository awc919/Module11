Macon County is located in the state of North Carolina. The population is approximately 37,014. Its county seat is Franklin. The Nantahala River runs through Macon County, flowing into the Little Tennessee River in Swain County. Wikipedia
<br></br>
Macon County, North Carolina, is known for its natural beauty, particularly the Nantahala National Forest, which offers outdoor activities like whitewater rafting and hiking, as well as for its rich mineral and gemstone deposits, drawing gem enthusiasts and rockhounds.

Residents of Macon County are experiencing communication issues again today, especially with certain
cellular telephone providers. The issues are affecting customers west of Buncombe County. 9-1-1
remained operational and callers could still place voice calls or send text messages to 9-1-1 and the
information was reliably transferred to Macon County. Service was completely restored around 1 PM.
The waiver of tipping and transfer fees for storm- related vegetative debris is expected to expire on
Thursday, October 17th at 5:00 PM. Standard fees will apply on October 18th.
<br></br>
FEMA representatives will be on-site at the distribution and disaster recovery center at 183 Holly Springs
Plaza in Franklin daily through October 24th. If any residents have questions or concerns or would like to
apply in person, someone will be available to assist them. The hours of operation are Monday through
Friday, 9AM until 4PM, and Saturday and Sunday, 9AM until 2 PM. 
<br></br>
Residents may also apply for Disaster Supplemental Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits at the
distribution and disaster recovery center during the same hours from October 18th until October 24th.
An email has been established for residents to submit unmet needs and other requests. Send information
to Heleneneeds@maconnc.org and the request or information will be routed to the most appropriate
agency, department or individual.
